# Challenge The Makings of a Programmer 50 XP

## The man, who tells you his name is Ritlin, asks you to follow him over to a few of his friends, fishing on the dock. “This one here has the makings of a Programmer!” Ritlin says. The group looks at you with eyes widening and mouths agape. Ritlin turns back to you and continues, “I haven’t seen nor heard tell of anybody who can wield that power in a million clock cycles of the CPU. Nobody has been able to do that since the Uncoded One showed up in these lands.” He describes the shadowy and mysterious Uncoded One, an evil power that rots programs and perhaps even the world itself. The Uncoded One’s presence has prevented anybody from wielding the power of programming, the only thing that might be able to stop it. Yet somehow, you have been able to grab hold of this power anyway. Ritlin’s companions suddenly seem doubtful. “Can you show them what you showed me? Use some of that Programming of yours to make a program? Maybe something with more than one statement in it?”

## Objectives:

### • Make a program with 5 Console.WriteLine statements in it.
### • Answer this question: How many statements do you think a program can contain?
